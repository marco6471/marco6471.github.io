    <p><strong>I thought i would lose it being home all day but im grateful that my girlfriend comes and visits me during quarantine, We still go out for walks for fresh air and talk about all the places we will go eat once this is over</strong></p>

    <p><strong>i still had loads of free time though since i wasnt able to go to the city or stay out too late so when i was home i was usually eating. My girlfriend taught me how to make some trendy coffee called Dalgona Coffee which is not so fun to make but pretty tasty</strong></p>

    <p><strong>my friends and i still missed hanging out together so we decided to celebrate bicycle day together. We linked up in the morning and headead towards the parking lot of the school we usually skate at however we all needed to scale the fence which proved more difficult than we originally thought</strong></p>
